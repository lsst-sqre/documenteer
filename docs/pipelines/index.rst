The `LSST Science Pipelines`_ is an EUPS-managed stack.
Documenteer includes specific command-line tools and Sphinx configurations to build documentation for both multi-package stacks (such as pipelines.lsst.io_) as well as individual or stand-alone stack packages (such as astro-metadata-translator.lsst.io_).
Documenteer also includes Sphinx extensions to help document domain-specific topics, such as LSST Tasks.
