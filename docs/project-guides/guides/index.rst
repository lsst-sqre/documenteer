Rubin user guide websites
#########################

*User guides* help users and team members understand and use your projects with conceptual documentation, how-to procedures, tutorials, and reference documentation.
At Rubin Observatory, every software package, web service, and even data release has a corresponding user guide.
Documenteer provides a configuration profile for creating branded user guides with `Sphinx <https://sphinx-doc.org>`.
