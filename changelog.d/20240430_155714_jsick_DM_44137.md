### Bug fixes

- Technotes ignore files in the repository with `.md`, `.rst`, and `.ipynb` extensions if they aren't the index file. Since technotes are single-page documents, only the index file should be used as a source file. This change lets authors include auxiliary notebooks with their technotes without having to explicitly exclude them from the technote build process. This is implemented with `technote.conf.extend_excludes_for_non_index_source`.

- In `documenteer.ext.lssttasks`, attempt to import `_pseudo_parse_arglist` from `sphinx.domains.python._annotations` before falling back to the `sphinx.domains.python` module. Ultimately this is a workaround.

- Fix setting the rebuild condition for the `documenteer.ext.githubbibcache` extension.

### Other changes

- Added `defusedxml` as a dev dependency. This is used by Sphinx's `sphinx.testing.fixtures`, but isn't included as a dependency by Sphinx itself. This change ensures that `defusedxml` is installed when running the tests.
