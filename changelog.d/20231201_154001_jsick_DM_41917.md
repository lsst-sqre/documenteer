### New features

- Use the Source Sans 3 variable font in technotes.
- Small improvements to the technote UI, including: linking to the *LSST the Docs* editions dashboards, showing the Rubin imagotype on mobile views, and moving the author listing to the main text column. In mobile, headers are also smaller and more compact to conserve vertical space.
- Upgrade to technote 0.6.
