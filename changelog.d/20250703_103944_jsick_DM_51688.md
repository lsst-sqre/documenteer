### New features

- For embedding a redoc page for API documentation, Documenteer now provides its own `documenteer.ext.redoc` extension. This replaces the previous `sphinxcontrib.redoc` extension, which is not being actively maintained. This new extension is automatically configured through `documenteer.conf.guide`, and therefore should not require any changes for most user guide projects. `documenteer.ext.redoc` drops support for referencing an OpenAPI specification file from a web URL. FastAPI projects can use `documenteer.ext.openapi` to generate an OpenAPI specification file from the FastAPI app.
