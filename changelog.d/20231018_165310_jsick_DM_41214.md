### Backwards-incompatible changes

- Now requires Sphinx 7 and later (and docutils 0.20 and later)

### New features

- A new extension, `documenteer.ext.githubbibcache`, can fetch and locally cache bibtex files from one or more public GitHub repositories. These bibfiles are automatically added to `sphinxcontrib-bibtex`'s `bibtex_files` configuration.
- Rubin technotes are now configured to automatically cache all bibfiles from the https://github.com/lsst/lsst-texmf repository. The `sphinxcontrib-bibtex` extension is available to technotes as well.
