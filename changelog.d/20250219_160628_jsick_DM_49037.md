### Bug fixes

- Pin Sphinx < 8.2 to avoid a bug/incompatibility with the `sphinxcontrib-bibtex` extension.

### Other changes

- Drop use of the pre-commit hook for prettier, and instead run prettier directly from the tox lint environment. This change is necessary because the prettier hook for pre-commit is no longer supported.

- Add Python 3.13 to the test matrix.
