### New features

- Added [sphinx-sitemap](https://sphinx-sitemap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for generating sitemaps in Rubin user guides and technotes. This will improve search engine and LLM/agent indexing of documentation. In user guides, the sitemap is linked in the HTML `head` for better discoverability.
- A new extension, `documenteer.ext.robots`, helps you generate a `robots.txt` file for informing web crawler access to documentation sites. In this initial version, the robots.txt file is generated when a sitemap.xml file is available in order to link to that sitemap. A robots.txt file isn't generated if a robots.txt file already exists.
- Documenteer's Sphinx extensions (`documenteer.ext.*`) now use Sphinx's built-in logging system, `sphinx.util.logging`, instead of the standard Python logging module.

### Bug fixes

- The Redoc site extension (`documenteer.ext.redoc`) now skips rendering early if the OpenAPI configuration is an empty list to avoid unnecessary processing.
