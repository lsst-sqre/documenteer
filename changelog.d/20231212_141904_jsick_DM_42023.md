### New features

- New command-line interface for technote authors.

  - `documenteer technote migrate` automates to the process of migrating an old technote to the new format.
  - `documenteer technote add-author` adds an author to a technote's `technote.toml` file using data from the `authordb.yaml` file in https://github.com/lsst/lsst-texmf.
  - `documenteer technote sync-authors` refreshing author information in a `technote.toml` file with information from the `authordb.yaml` file. This requires that individual authors have `internal_id` fields to correlate with `authordb.yaml`.
