### Bug fixes

- `setuptools` is now included in the core package dependencies. The `documenteer.ext.bibtex` extension uses `pybtex`, which is turn uses `pkg_resources` from `setuptools`. In Python 3.12, setuptools is not available in Python environments by default. This direct dependency can be removed once `pybtex` is updated to use `importlib.metadata`.
