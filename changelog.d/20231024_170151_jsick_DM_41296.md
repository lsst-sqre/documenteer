### Backwards-incompatible changes

- Delete the `refresh-lsst-bib` CLI command. Technotes now automatically vendor lsst-texmf's bib files and cache them using `documenteer.ext.githubbibcache`.
- Delete the `build-stack-docs` CLI command, which was replaced by the `stack-docs` and `package-docs` CLIs in Documenteer 0.3.0.
- The `documenteer.conf.pipelines` and `documenteer.conf.pipelinespkg` configuration modules now derive from `documenteer.conf.guide`. In doing so, the Pipelines documentation configuration works the same as Rubin Guides, but with additional configuration for pipelines-specific Sphinx extensions and other configurations. With this change, the `lsst-sphinx-bootstrap-theme` is no longer used by Documenteer.
- The `documenteer.sphinxext` module has been removed and the existing Sphinx extensions within it are now available from `documenteer.ext`. It's no longer possible to use `documenteer.sphinxext` to automatically load all Documenteer Sphinx extensions. Extensions need to now be added individually to the `extensions` configuration variable in `conf.py`. The migrated extension modules are:

  - `documenteer.ext.bibtex`
  - `documenteer.ext.jira`
  - `documenteer.ext.lsstdocushare`
  - `documenteer.ext.lssttasks`
  - `documenteer.ext.mockcoderefs`
  - `documenteer.ext.packagetoctree`

### New features

- Add `sphinx-jinja` to the Rubin guides configuration by default.
- Add `sphinx-rediraffe` to the Rubin guides configuration by default.
