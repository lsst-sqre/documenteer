### New features

- Added a [sphinx.redirects] table to `documenteer.toml`. This provides support for configuring page redirects from the TOML configuratin. Redirects are useful if pages move because of a content re-organization. This feature is based on [sphinx-rediraffe](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/sphinxext-rediraffe).
