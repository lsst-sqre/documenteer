### New features

- Added a `[sphinx.redirects]` table to `documenteer.toml`. This provides support for configuring page redirects from the TOML configuratin. Redirects are useful if pages move because of a content re-organization. This feature is based on [sphinx-rediraffe](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/sphinxext-rediraffe).

- Added the [sphinxcontrib-youtube](https://sphinxcontrib-youtube.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for embedded YouTube and Vimeo videos into documentation pages. This extension is available for both user guides (`documenteer.conf.guide`) and technotes (`documenteer.conf.technotes`).
