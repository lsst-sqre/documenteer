### Bug fixes

- Fixed the monospace text baseline alignment issue in Safari for technotes by updating to technote 0.8.0. In this version, the font size of the code is set to be 0.9em so that the browser doesn't push the text below the baseline in case its larger than the Source Sans body text. This version also changes the font size on the html element to 100% and instead increases the baseline body text size to 1.1rem on the body element. This change should help technotes respect the user's browser font size settings while also making the rem unit work as expected.
